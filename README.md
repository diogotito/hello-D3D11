# HelloWindow.sln

Me learning Windows API, Direct3D 11 and <i title="One doesn't simply finish learning C++">C++</i>:

I started this by [following](HelloWindow/HelloWindow.cpp)
Gargaj's [Demoscene for Dummies](https://gargaj.github.io/demos-for-dummies) tutorial,
with the intent of maybe delivering my first demo at [Inércia 2025](https://2025.inercia.pt).
But as soon as the link to Microsoft Learn's
[Your First Windows Program](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/your-first-windows-program) 
appeared, I decided to die on the hill of learning Windows API (FKA win32api) too thoroughly,
and all I had to show after 18 days of starting this was "My first triangle with Direct3D 11" (which I kept to myself),
though I upgraded it to two *(2!!)* animated triangles following some imaginary beat.

## TODO (maybe)

- [ ] Reload and recompile shader files when they are modified (i.e. the simplest demotool)
- [ ] Find that MaterialMaker library that does SDFs and generates shader code
      and try to use it in my graphics pipeline
- [ ] Just finish the damn tutorial!
- [ ] Relearn Linear Algebra
- [ ] Scratch all this and start exploring using Godot to make my little "demo tools"  
      (I gotta show Godot's demo potential next year!
      (or just use WebGL)
      (or just do something silly with PowerPoint or RPG Maker VX Ace or Flash or the Gameboy))
